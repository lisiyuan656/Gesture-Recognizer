## Task Assignments
Project will consist of 3 main parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
Preprocessing will be divided and conquered as follows:
- Noise removal (filtering algorithms): Siyuan Li
- Image resizing (scaling algorithms): Jiyuan Li
- Region segmentation: Reid Fu

We will use object skeleton, interest points, and principal component axes/values as features.
Feature extraction will be divided and conquered as follows:
- Principal component analysis: Reid Fu
- Skeletonization: Jiyuan Li
- Interest points: Siyuan Li

Classification will be done using a neural net, which will be done by Reid Fu

Data will be obtained from http://www.massey.ac.nz/~albarcza/gesture_dataset2012.html

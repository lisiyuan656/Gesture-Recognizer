Project idea: We want to design a gesture detection system. The inputs of our system would be images of a person with some pre-defined gestures using his/her hands. Our system will detect which gesture the person is making. 
There will be roughly three parts for the system: 
a)	Noise removal, image resizing and region segmentation part, in which the system removes the background noise in the image and segment the image. (Filtering algorithms, scaling and medial axis transform)
b)	Feature extraction part. (PCA and skeletonzation , interests points algorithms)
c)	Classification part. (Neural networks classification algorithm)
Where to get the data: We will use this dataset: http://www.massey.ac.nz/~albarcza/gesture_dataset2012.html
